# NMS Data Ingestion and Management for RaceStudio (Rough Draft)
## Overview
This project streamlines the ingestion and management of data from RaceStudio into
GitHub. The main objective is to create a robust, automated system to organize and
store all car-related data in a centralized data lake. This system ensures the
following:
- Automated naming conventions for consistency.
- Quick and efficient movement of files from RaceStudio to GitHub.
- Preservation of original RaceStudio-compatible CSV files with metadata for reanalysis.
- Simplified data access for team members via a user-friendly interface.

By centralizing and organizing our data, we aim to improve collaboration, enable quicker access to valuable insights, and build the foundation for advanced data analysis.

## Features
1. Automated Data Ingestion
    - Developed a notebook in Python to pull data files from a local directory.
    - Used Github integrated API (Application Programming Interface) endpoints to write and upload files with the correct naming conventions.
    - Ensured compatibility to simplify the process for new data runs and have it be automated and not manual.
  
2. CSV File Parsing
Implemented a parsing system to process the RaceStudio CSV files:
    - Extracted and preserved essential metadata? (e.g. run time of a file)
    - Cloned CSV into two compatible versions: (elaborate?)
        - RaceStudio compatible
        - Raw CSV
   
3. Data Organization and Storage
- Created a structured storage approach on Github: (confirm?)
    - RaceStudio Format Directory
    - Raw Format Directory

4. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
    - Designed and built a friendly user interface for querying and accessing data:
      - Allows team members to search for specific datasets
      - Simplifies pullinf files from Github.
      - Provides metadata summaries for quick insights (?)
    - Focused on user experience to ensure accessibility for all team members.

## Loading Data into GitHub
This typically invloves automating the upload process of CSV files from a local
directory to GitHub. The key steps include:
- Loading of Local Files: The local directory is scanned for any new CSV files generated by RaceStudio.
- Parsing File Metadata: Before any uploads, metadata is extracted and logged for organizational purposes.
- GitHub API Integration: Using the GitHub RESTful API, files are uploaded to designated repositories with automated naming conventions based on file metadata. (?)
- File Structure and Maintenance: Files are stored in two formats within clearly separated directories in the GitHub repository.
